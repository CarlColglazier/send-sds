libmidisd is a C library that uses alsa and libsndfile
to interface your Linux system with devices supporting
the MIDI Sample Dump Standard.
Right now it is a just a command-line tool to get the
basic functionality tested and working. Eventually I will
package it as a shared library.
This tool was born out of frustration with the lack
of SDS send/receive support on Linux. Much of the code is
taken directly from [bsl/send-sds][1].
